Project: Study Plan

Implement a system to maintain study plans for students. 
The system should be able to maintain multiple students, each with a personal study plan.
The study plan consists of courses that a student has planned to take.
For each course the system should maintain the schedule: 
                which periods and at which times the course events take place. 
                For each student the system should be able to
                present a personal schedule for each period, depending on 
                which courses the student has selected.

You should consider at least the following classes:

Student, including student number, name, and list of courses selected

Course, including at least course code, name and information of the course time table

Requirements:

User interface to operate on system. Text-based interface is sufficient

Program should be able to add new courses to the course catalogue, 
along with their schedules (period, weekdays and hours of teaching event)

Program should be able to add new students to the database

Students should be able to add one of the existing courses to their personal study plan

Students should be able to print a personal schedule for
 a given period (and year of studies). The program should warn if there are overlapping events.

Advanced features:

Visually nice way of presenting the study schedule

List of all students on a particular course and study event

(think of something else yourself)
